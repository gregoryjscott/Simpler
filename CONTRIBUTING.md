# Git and GitHub

We used git and GitHub to store and manage our content. The content can
include source code, documentation, scripts, etc.

Steps
1. **Install git.** GitHub has good instructions in their Help section.
2. **Setup a GitHub account.**

Technically, some contributions can be made entirely through GitHub
without needing to install git locally. However, this document will
assume the user is using git and the user's local drive to push 
contributions to GitHub.
